<mark>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing</mark> and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not <b>only five centuries</b>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <i>It was popularised</i> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including <u>versions of Lorem</u> Ipsum.<s>100</s>   90  <br>
